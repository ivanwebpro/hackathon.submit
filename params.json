As someone who's been on both sides of the fence, I've found the user's perspective to be particularly frustrating cause 75% of the Terms and Agreements is often common sense or irrelevant to the user!\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, we needs to understand why it exists in the first place.\r\n\r\n1. People do not read Terms and Agreements **because they're long and exhaustive**\r\n2. They are *long and exhaustive* to **protect the content creator from legal action and to set ground rules for users**\r\n\r\n**So can we make them short?**\r\nThe answer is no. This would sacrifice protection for the content creator\r\n\r\n**Can we make users read all of it?**\r\nThe answer is also no - forcing it would cause users to get fed up and leave.\r\n\r\n*Let's face it, there is **no perfect solution.** *\r\n\r\nWe can't stop users from not reading the Terms and Agreements, but perhaps we can at least make them **aware** of what's relevant to them.\r\n\r\nSo instead of having them check a box, let's **highlight the main points** and let them read further if they are interested. \r\n\r\n**It's about putting a convenience and choice infront of the user**\r\n\r\n[DEMO](http://ukkkb6776eaa.kp1234.koding.io)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nBasic Implementation       |Translation API\r\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\r\n![](images/basicexample.gif)  |  ![](images/translation.gif)\r\n\r\nDictionary Definitions (Glosbe or Wikipedia API!!)    | \r\n:-------------------------:|\r\n![](images/dictionary.gif)| \r\n\r\nTTS Capability (TTS-API.COM OR VOICERSS(MASHAPE) API!!)| \r\n:-------------------------:|\r\n![](images/tts.gif)| \r\n\r\n\r\nSemantic UI Theme       |Bootstrap Theme\r\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\r\n![](images/semantic.gif)  |  ![](images/bootstrap.gif)\r\n\r\n## APIs used\r\n\r\n**Third Party Services**\r\n\r\n1.
